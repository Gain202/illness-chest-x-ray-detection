# Chest Disease and Healthy Chest Image Dataset
Data-set to detect illness on the human thorax;
This data set-was created by Federal Institute of Esp√≠rito Santo, from Brazil

## Chest Disease and Healthy Chest Image Dataset
This dataset contains chest images, classified into two main categories: pulmonary diseases and healthy chest. The images were collected to support research and machine learning model training aimed at medical diagnostics, particularly in radiology and analysis of X-ray or CT scan images.

**Description**
The dataset includes chest radiographs (X-rays) from both patients with pulmonary diseases and individuals with healthy lungs. The images are organized into two main folders, one for diseases and the other for healthy chest. Each category contains a variety of images representing different types of pulmonary conditions and normal chest anatomy variations.
  Folder 1: Pulmonary Diseases
  Contains images of patients with various pulmonary conditions, such as pneumonia, infiltration, atelectasis, Nodule, pulmonary fibrosis, among others.
  Folder 2: Healthy Chest
  Contains images of individuals with healthy lungs, serving as a baseline for comparison with pathological conditions.
  
**Objective**
This dataset was created to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning and artificial intelligence models aimed at automatic pulmonary disease diagnosis. It can be used for:    
 - Development of models for detecting pulmonary diseases.
 - Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image analysis.
 - Study of image segmentation techniques for identifying affected areas in the chest.
 - Improvement of computer-aided diagnostic systems.
   
**How to Use**
- Download the dataset.
- Extract the contents of the compressed file.
- Use the images in the folders as needed for your experiments, research, or machine learning model training.
